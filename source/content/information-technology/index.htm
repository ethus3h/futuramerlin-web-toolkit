</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This section documents the Ember computing environment: a centralized append-only information store, a computer operating system integrated with that information store, and related specifications.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The computing environment will consist of the following components:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Development principles, describing the process to use for creating the computing environment</li>
    <li>Data formats: Specifications of the data formats used by the computing environment.</li>
    <li>Client app</li>
    <li>Server apps:
        <ul>
            <li>Public-facing API</li>
            <li>Search engine</li>
            <li>Storage backend</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Development principles</h2>
<h3>Prerequisites for code to be added to the repository</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Code must be readable and documented.</li>
    <li>Code must not cause or have failing tests.</li>
    <li>Code should include thorough automatic test coverage.</li>
    <li>Code must address a deviation from the current specification (bug, missing feature, <span class="foreign-text">etc.</span>), and may not contain other code.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How issues should be prioritised</h3>
<p>Ordered from highest priority to lowest priority</p>
<ol>
    <li>Incorrect results</li>
    <li>Crashes and similar critical usability issues</li>
    <li>Slow code with a significant impact on usability</li>
    <li>Minor usability issues</li>
    <li>Slow code with a moderate impact on usability</li>
    <li>Regressions and lost features</li>
    <li>Missing features</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data formats</h2>

<h3>Ember Language</h3>
<p>Objective: Develop a machine-readable language that can be source-to-source translated into both C and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Ember Language programs may optionally declare a non-default language profile to use: Basic, which restricts the program to a core subset of the language, and Dangerous, which includes language features which are probably a bad idea to use, but may be needed in some cases.</p>
<p>Ember Language programs can optionally run in one of three modes: Document, Terminal, and Web; these modes set up a basic environment for the program for running with a graphical raster display output, with a character-based terminal output, and as a Web server, respectively.</p>
