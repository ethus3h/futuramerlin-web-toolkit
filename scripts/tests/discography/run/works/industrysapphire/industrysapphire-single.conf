note,This is simply <a href="draft-2017m11d18n2.htm">the 2017m11d18n2 version</a> of this piece transcoded into FLAC (and consequently should be acoustically identical).
instrumentation,vocals, ambient sound recorded on 2017 Oct. 12 and 2017 Oct. 18 in Oakes Room in Fogler Library, University of Maine (incl. vocals) (I'm not 100% certain, but am fairly sure, that the sound recorded on 2017 Oct. 18 was recorded in the Oakes Room like the first recording was)
