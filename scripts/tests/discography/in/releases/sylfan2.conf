date,2009 (~29 September 2009? 29 September 2009 is the earliest file modification I can see, on the album artwork (supposedly for the 17-track version) that seems to be for the 19-track version. So, my conclusion is that it was probably released ~29 September 2009. It is quite possible that it was however released later; 2 October 2009 is another likely date, as the second artwork panel (the one with the most complex track listings) was last modified 2 October 2009, indicating that an error in the listings may have been fixed then for the release. For simplicity's sake, I will use ~29 September 2009 in the listings here.)
