<p>As it turns out, once I thought the new design was pretty much good to go aside from a couple of minor tweaks, a few big issues presented themselves, most notably that the logo has a scrollbar in Google Chrome. Here&#8217;s the list of what&#8217;s left to get done:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking release:
<ul>
<li>Fix logo having a scrollbar in Chrome.</li>
<li>Fix broken positioning / media queries in Safari.</li>
<li>Finish the content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not blocking release:
<ul>
<li>Content changes:
<ul>
<li>Add &#8220;All Topics&#8221; link to Categories tab in blog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Layout bugs:
<ul>
<li>Make Close button on blog menu dropdowns not collide with dropdown contents.</li>
<li>Make first and last items in toolbar not draw their edge borders all the way down the toolbar when there are multiple rows of buttons on the toolbar.</li>
<li>Fix lines in the fancy buttons&#8217; backgrounds in Chrome (also slightly affects Firefox).</li>
<li>Clear the floated images in blog-test/index.htm.</li>
<li>Fix entry-title not wrapping around entry-meta.</li>
<li>Fix blockquote end quotation mark not being inset.</li>
<li>Fix buttons not showing the highlights correctly (use SVG instead of PNG).</li>
<li>Fix &#8220;Telephones and Tags&#8221; header being indented unexpectedly in blog-test/index.htm.</li>
<li>Fix zoomed-in media query bug (? As of this writing, 2016 Feb. 17, I don&#8217;t remember exactly what this was or how to reproduce it).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Features:
<ul>
<li>Make toolbar and pagination sticky / always visible (feature request).
<ul>
<li>I think this probably wouldn&#8217;t make much sense when using a small screen, because the toolbar and pagination would perchance risk obscuring the content entirely, which would rather defeat the point of me having a Web site in the first place, I dare say. Maybe have this be a togglable option? It could be a button at the bottom of the navigation menu, perhaps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
