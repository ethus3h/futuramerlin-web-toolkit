<h1 class="title">Web site and Wreathe updates</h1>

<p>Following up on <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/c/2016/02/24/2767-important-update-for-wreathe-os-users/">the previous post on the Wreathe GNU/Linux distribution</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>No Wreathe versions except <em>Wreathe 5: Rain</em> and <em>Wreathe 7r2: Elegy</em> are currently supported; users running other versions of Wreathe are advised to update to <em>Wreathe 7r2: Elegy</em>.</li>
<li><em>Wreathe 5: Rain</em> support will end 1 October 2016; users currently running <em>Wreathe 5: Rain</em> are advised to update to <em>Wreathe 7r2: Elegy</em> before that date.</li>
<li><em>Wreathe 7r3: Elegiac</em> is now being actively developed, and will be based on the Gentoo GNU/Linux distribution. Driver issues are currently blocking development (the OS crashes before boot completes when using the proprietary NVIDIA drivers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the Futuramerlin Web site:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new design went live on 6 March 2016.</li>
<li>User acceptance feedback indicates that the new design is suboptimal.</li>
<li>The new design renders the Web site unusable in current versions of the Konqueror Web browser (the menu covers the page content).</li>
<li>I plan to change the way the design is implemented so that all browsers are served a basic HTML page, and then JavaScript is used for visual styling in browsers that support it. This should make most or all users able to access the Web site&#8217;s content, but will detrimental effects as follow:
<ul>
<li>Users with JavaScript disabled and a browser that supports the site&#8217;s CSS will see an un-styled version of the site.</li>
<li>Users with JavaScript whitelisting may be prompted to enable JavaScript for the site, even though using the site does not require JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I do not know how to resolve those two issues without making the Web site harder to use on mobile computers.</li>
<li>I may change some aspects of the design, or make it customisable, to increase user acceptance.</li>
</ul>
<p>General updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>I plan to add a publicly-accessible issue tracker to the Web site, or configure <a href="http://futuramerlin.com/d/s/mantis/">the existing login-only Mantis installation</a> to allow search engines to index it.</li>
</ul>
