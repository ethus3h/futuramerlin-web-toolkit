<h2>Copy of dynamic Web site content</h2>
    <p>The dynamic content of the Web site is mostly mirrored in static form <a href="https://github.com/ethus3h/ember-web-site/tree/master/static">in the Web site's Git repository</a> and consequently <a href="/static">in the site</a> as well. This process is not automated to occur regularly, and the static copy may be out of date.</p>
