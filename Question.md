These screen shots show four different browser zoom levels. The only thing that I changed between the four screen shots was the browser's zoom level. In the first two but not in the second two, the contents are centered and the background panels are aligned symmetrically to the text.

Why does this happen?

To make sure this wasn't caused my buggy media queries, which was my first thought, I deleted all the media queries in the developer tools style editor.
