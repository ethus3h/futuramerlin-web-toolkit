They are presented here in the Ember section of the Web site because they may be useful in understanding the thought processes and potential biases that shaped the Ember project.</p> <h2 id="Ethics_and_Ember">Ethics and Ember</h2> <p>From a perspective of fundamentals, there are a few things necessary for life: food, water, and shelter. Without these basic elements, humans would not survive very long. If one is hard working and clever, one can provide these things for one’s self, by living off the land. When humans start to live together in communities, things become more complicated; medical care and education become important. The goals of a community are to make life more secure and predictable for the community’s members, and to reduce the hardships associated with “primitive” living (living without the support systems of a complex society). But with those goals comes a problem: how are those goals to be effectively implemented? Through the development of strategies such as specialization of individuals’ abilities and the creation of technological solutions, these challenges can be met.</p> <p><br></p> <p>As more people start living together, though, they will almost inevitably come into conflict. What can be done when the individual’s interests conflict with those of the society? What about conflicts between individuals? To deal with these issues, laws and a justice system can be put into place. An economy or labor-sharing strategy can aid in the exchange of services and goods, to avoid conflicts over these matters. A free market economy is helpful to a society, because it redirects the energies of greed and uses them as a force for technological development.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Philosophical discourse becomes important in many areas, such as the resolution of the conflicts and challenges of a complex society, and the research into understanding the world around us. This discourse leads to the development of more complex technology drawing on the ideas of the society, then leading to debates about ethics, to scientific investigation about the nature of our world, and to the development of ways to understand and accept who we are, such as religion and science.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Ideas, knowledge, and art become economically motivated, and so copyright and patent laws are established to encourage and protect innovation in these areas. The wide availability of information becomes increasingly relevant, and information technology and distribution systems such as books and computers are developed. Support infrastructures are created and strengthened, to protect society against threats both external and internal, such as disease, crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and war.</p> <p><br></p> <p>I would like to attempt to improve on the existing systems that have developed for solving these problems. I would like to undertake this project in an incremental, scalable manner, rather than creating a complex system that would need to be implemented all at once to be effective. That way, small improvements could be made without attempting to undertake the insurmountable task of improving larger components of society at once. This incremental development would allow for the strengths of the existing systems to persist, as well.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The many texts I have studied have helped me understand better how I could go about achieving these goals, and have provided interesting and valuable insights about what I believe. In many cases, it is difficult or impossible to prove to the satisfaction of a large number of people what the ideal systems are for society; in such cases I can only at once stand by my own beliefs and also accept that other valid solutions and reasonings can exist as well.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The most important thing I think I will achieve, which has both shaped and been shaped by my experience of study, is the incremental development of improved and redeveloped societal structure and infrastructure. To this end, I have gathered a number of disparate elements of the project under the name of “Ember”, for ease of reference; these diverse objectives I believe have the potential to improve the general standard of living. At the same time, it is important to ensure that the Ember project does not fall into the same pitfalls that befell Project Xanadu, despite their many parallels and similarities.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Project Xanadu and Ember are both projects with lofty goals, born out of a Nietzscheian rage at the status quo, aiming to radically transform and reshape various aspects of society for the better. They are both ambitious, and championed by someone without a thorough understanding of the technological and economic realities and limitations of the world around them. They both are driven by grand ideas, with little thought given to short term practical implementation and utility of those ideas. They both have the potential to absorb vast amounts of investment without return. My hope is that by assessing and strategizing around these similar aspects, and understanding the ways in which they relate to Project Xanadu’s failure to produce, such a catastrophe can be avoided by Ember.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Ember is a multifaceted project to develop a scalable environment for building an effective society. The goal of the project is to create a system to enable efficacy, efficiency, and justice within society, by creating a social structure that would work to create an efficient opt-in society within the framework of the diverse and valuable existing societies. The plan for the project is to pursue these goals by developing individual components that each provide an integral part of the whole societal system. My current proposal is comprised of several components, including a coordination organization, a philosophy of ethics, a nonprofit standards-driven services collective, a computing environment, a reference collection of the most important knowledge, a library of great cultural works, a spiritual framework, and a multimedia artwork.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The four subjects that will prove integral in the effective development of the Ember project that I would principally like to discuss in this paper and which have been of most import to my journey of learning are ethics, rights, prejudice and bigotry, and theology.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Ethics are one of the central aspects of a complex society, with an understanding of what is “justice” being necessary for the establishment of effective justice systems, and an understanding of what is ethically acceptable scientific research and technological development being necessary for a society to respect the dignity of the world.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In the Zimbardo prison experiment, we saw an influential and famous experiment that was ethically very dubious, and likely had lasting effects on the research participants. Is such research justified? This is a hard case to make, as the benefits derived from the Zimbardo experiment have been doubtful at best due to the poorly undertaken nature of the research. However, could such research that damages the participants be considered ethical in any scenario? Could it, perhaps, but only with the full understanding and consent of the participants? It seems likely that the nature of such an experiment is fundamentally harmful in such a way that it would be best to attempt to gain the knowledge through other, more ethical research methods if at all possible before trying such research techniques. By no means should such research practices as those seen in Zimbardo be standard or generally accepted within the scientific community.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Some scientific research is seen as harming the public interest for other reasons, such as Galileo Galilei’s assertions of a heliocentric planetary model, which were regarded as heresy by the Catholic church, which was the dominant social force in determining matters of ethics and morality in Europe at that time. This is a matter of ethics, as opposed to a matter purely of science, as the scientific results were considered to be evil. However, it seems that Galileo’s research has done no lasting harm, considering that it has become widely accepted and is no longer a  matter of significant contention. Perhaps this acceptance is because the issue with Galileo’s research is the results he found, while with Zimbardo’s it is the ethics of the manner in which the research was undertaken.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Rights are an important social issue. In Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf, we encountered the debate about what rights should be protected in the thorny instance of an individual with mental challenges. One can consider whether Septimus Warren Smith had the right to not be controlled by Holmes and Bradshaw. Referring to Septimus, Woolf writes: “Lately he had become excited suddenly for no reason (and both Dr. Holmes and Sir William Bradshaw said excitement was the worst thing for him)” (Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. p. 140). Does not Septimus have the right to exist without being bothered, regardless of whether it is considered the best thing for him? He does no one else any harm by being as he is, and is not disrupting society in any way, except inasmuch as it may perhaps reduce his ability to contribute to it. And even that seems that it may be excusable in light of the value of one’s right to liberty, much as one could make such an argument for the legitimization of a right to suicide.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Likewise, is involuntary confinement of someone who is not a threat to society moral or ethical? Does it violate the tradition of habeas corpus? “Worshipping proportion, Sir William not only prospered himself but made England prosper, secluded her lunatics, forbade childbirth, penalised despair, made it impossible for the unfit to propagate their views until they, too, shared his sense of proportion” (Ibid. p. 99). Does Bradshaw have any right whatsoever to impose such restraints, to place such barriers upon freedom of expression and action? Perhaps one could argue that the mentally incompetent are incapable by nature of exercising these rights appropriately and effectively, and thus should not be afforded them. Nevertheless, even such disabled and tragically affected individuals still likely have the right to have their desires and conscience and feelings paid respect and honored by the society around them. They are, presumably, individuals with their own emotions, realities, and conceptions of the world, thus deserving the same respect afforded to the healthy in any just and non-oppressive society. These are important social issues to consider and address in the development of an evolving societal system.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Bigotry, hatred, racism, prejudice, and oppression are critical issues to address in the modern society, with tragedies such as slavery, genocide, and wartime racism persisting strongly into the present. An understanding needs to be built and lessons learned from history about how these elements can be addressed effectively and thoroughly, protecting the rights of all. In several of the texts we have studied in this sequence, we encountered racism as a prominent theme, most notably in The Souls of Black Folk and Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. In The Souls of Black Folk, by prominent author W. E. B. Du Bois, it is written that “the South believed an educated Negro to be a dangerous Negro” (Du Bois, W. E. B.. The Souls of Black Folk. p. 24). Du Bois considered this assessment by the South to have some validity, because of the role of education in bringing forth “dissatisfaction and discontent” (Ibid.). Such discontent would likely have been far greater among African Americans, due to the profound injustices they experienced. In addition, this generalization shows the egregious violations of rights and hatred that can emerge, piling injustice on top of bitter injustice, when one group is considered inferior to another.</p> <p><br></p> <p>In Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, we see the brutal realities of life as an African American woman in the antebellum south. It reveals in its tragedy the horrors that they underwent through no fault of their own but merely the chance of having a different skin color. The recent development of feminist philosophies such as those seen in Virginia Woolf’s and Adrienne Rich’s work is clearly a step in the right direction, helping to sway the pendulum away from injustice, continuing along the path boldly set by the civil rights movement in the 1960s. However, racism and racial violence still persist, as evidenced and highlighted by the recent racial tension surrounding police brutality.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Theology plays an important role in society, providing a way for individuals to understand their role in that society and in the world. Occam’s Razor is a famous statement to the effect that “No more things should be presumed to exist…” (Haddon, Mark. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. p. 90) than are needed to explain the observations about which a collective truth has been established through consensus. Despite the seeming rationality of that statement, I nevertheless often choose to believe things on faith, despite being unable to prove them through scientific observation and logic. I come to these conclusions frequently as ways to best explain the parts of the world around me that I do not understand scientifically, but nevertheless seem to observe on a daily basis and believe to be real: life, emotions, and other similarly difficult-to-quantify elements of the world around us. By considering the world and drawing my own conclusions, I can create my own worldview, as real to me as the perceptions that are established through consensus and scientific reasoning.</p> <p><br></p> <p>The Music of Life presents a model of life that can be mistakenly argued to be unscientific, because it does not explain many of the vagaries of the way life and the way one’s personality and other traits that make one an individual come about. This model indicates that these traits are not coded in one’s genes, but originate otherwise. This model is scientifically reasonable, though, since the systems by which these traits develop and function are not fully or thoroughly understood, and are likely not completely determined quanta that can be effectively evaluated by measuring systems. Perhaps it is not possible to understand these traits at all. Perhaps one wishes genes might provide the definitive coding for an organism, providing a thorough way to comprehend the way that organism evolves and develops. However, this is not the way genes work.</p> <p><br></p> <p>I believe that God has created a sort of fettered omniscience for Himself, and has taken away His direct influence over the world and given living things the capacity for moral self-direction. This aspect of the world’s traits has been implemented in what has been recognized as the theory of the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics, according to which nothing can be predicted with absolute certainty. Traditional thinking would seem to hold that through a comprehensive understanding of all the positions and vectors in a closed system, all of the states of that situation — past, present, and future — can be known simultaneously. Yet the observer effect leads to the situation that the most basic particles of matter are unable to be observed or predicted, because any observation will inevitably change their state, thus contributing to the chaos inherent in the uncertainty principle. In a lecture on quantum mechanics, the speaker discussed the idea of determinism: I believe that these maxims of unpredictability lead to the effective disintegration of multi-scale determinism, while it does seem to remain effective and in effect in the world on our scale. This unpredictability enables the world to exist as it does with true moral sovereignty, without the consequential ethical nihilism of the philosophies of fate or predestination.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Gnosticism is a group of belief systems sharing certain core tenets, particularly the focus on the development of sophia (wisdom) to attain gnosis (knowledge) and on the rejection of some elements of the physical world in the endeavor to attain ascendance into the spiritual. It shares common themes and elements with many Christian and other belief systems. In the Gnostic Gospel according to Mary Magdalene, it is written “There is no sin, but it is you who make sin when you do the things that are like the nature of adultery, which is called sin.” (Gospel according to Mary Magdalene. Chapter 4, verse 26.) This sentence emphasizes the Gnostic nature of the text, in its equating of sin with adultery providing a connection to the traditional Gnostic focus on the rejection of elements of the physical in the interest of the finding of knowledge through wisdom. While it would be hard to prove concretely that things like adultery are bad, that badness can nevertheless be understood: it is a truth that can be taken on faith, it can be understood through the collective wisdom of society, or it can be felt in one’s heart.</p> <p><br></p> <p>Present in my mind is the world presented by Bacon in The New Atlantis. While it isn’t presented as a dystopia in his novel, and seems that Bacon considers such an environment to be ideal, in light of the experiences of society nowadays approaching its traits in some ways, it raises frightening questions. For instance, what should the role be of surveillance in a society? In Bensalem, the society presented in the book, surveillance is present. And yet, surveillance today can seem frightening, considering the potential for its abuse. How should safeguards be put in place to simultaneously enable effective surveillance, while curtailing its abuse?</p> <p><br></p> <p>Considering these elements in the process of creating a system for alternative society development is clearly a vital part of the process. Failure to do so can produce a system which is unjust, incompetent, and inefficient. By avoiding this failure, the system developed can embody its principle objectives of creating an efficient, effective, and just society. The concepts that in the many great texts of civilizations provide invaluable insights for the development of the Ember project.</p> <p>Spiritual life is dependent on four central elements: compassion, morality, wisdom, and beauty. These elements are deeply interwoven; compromise, discretion, and balance are best used to balance them, just as the values of rights must be weighed in the rights-centric social contract I propose in the first section of this document. Compassion is the desire to ease others’ passage through their lives; it is closely related to and often a product of empathy, and is also sometimes partially or fully undertaken for the sense of satisfaction gained from having given aid. It could be argued that this makes compassionate acts fundamentally selfish, but I see no harm in such motivation, since the value of the actions remains untainted. The elements of compassion sustain society through the prevention of behavioral and cultural anarchy. Because society is a product of the interdependence of needs, it is also defined by the interdependence of aid; this is the fundamental premise of the social contract binding together the organization that I propose.</p> <h2 id="Ethics">Ethics</h2> <p>Compassion frequently engenders several traits of human interaction, most notably honesty, nonjudgmentalism, and friendship. Honesty is often a product of compassion, but bear in mind that sometimes it is more compassionate to be silent or dishonest in some situations. In general, it is best to not be judgmental of others, with it being more productive to criticize actions than the individuals making them; it is also frequently helpful in communication on such matters to speak using “I statements” (statements regarding one’s perception of the situation) than by stating as fact what one perceives about the other person. Friendship does not necessarily equal companionship; friendship is, rather, an effort to be aware of the other person’s feelings and have a special interest in their happiness and wellbeing.</p> <p>There is a somewhat poorly defined (in that it is commonly understood without reference to quantifiable metrics) concept I find worthy of consideration here: that of “evil”. It is a label commonly applied to things that fall outside of the bounds of the dominant moral dicta of the group or authority applying the label. Nevertheless, evil can be accurately assessed and described through its relation to specific fundamental premises relevant to the maintenance of an ordered society. Using such a basis for its description, evil is any action which disrupts the significant objectives and wellbeing of the society, culture, or individual affected by the actions beyond what is reasonable, and is justifiable by practicalities, such as survival and convenience. This concept is connected to the traditional Christian philosophy of everyone being a sinner (for my purposes, “sinner” referring to a person who has committed evil actions), but, given such a definition of “sinner”, I think that such a generalization would necessarily not include the “reasonable and justifiable” limitation, since human life almost invariably disrupts in some way the life around it (for example, in all probability most commonly in the northeastern United States by stepping on insect life and vegetation, which is difficult to avoid as a consequence of their ubiquity; or by eating food, a process which frequently involves the killing of edible plants and/or animals or the denial of a seed's and/or egg's germination), thus rendering nearly every human a sinner, and also a committer of evil acts assuming the conditional above is not taken into account. For this reason I think that a sinner should be considered as anyone who acts in a manner to disrupt the significant objectives and wellbeing of a society, culture, or individual, regardless of whether such disruption is potentially justifiable. (It also would presumably be evil to harbor fantasies of evil acts, since such fantasy would likely lead to some level of mental justification of them, subconsciously increasing the likelihood of the fantasizer committing such acts; although since it is presumably unreasonable to expect perfection in the area of avoiding such fantasy it is likely to fall under the conditional I mentioned above, except perhaps in extreme cases. This concept is quite contentious, however, given the widespread culture of respect (in Western society, at any rate) towards the absolute freedom of the mind. Personally, I have reservations about restrictions on thought, especially in terms of the possibility of legislating them; however I do think that speech and other expression should be restricted in some cases.)</p> <p>The way I see it, modern society is deeply permeated by immorality. Excessive materialism, pointless inefficiency, and many other challenges are widely accepted as the norm, and it is frequently difficult or impossible to survive without participating in their perpetuation.</p> <p>Death can bring emotional pain with it for those around someone who has died. However, it is a common aspect of life within this world, and killing is often an important element of survival. It seems to be common in some ways of looking at the world to consider some lives as more valuable than others, for example, from lowest to highest, plants, non-human animals, and humans), however I consider all to be equally valuable, with some protected above others by their innate power or their isolation, by the social contracts to which they are party, and/or by the emotional attachment of others to them. It can be sometimes difficult to identify clearly what holds life; consequently, it is likely preferable to respect them as if they do.</p> <p>There are fundamental rights that should be protected by a social contract: the right to their health, the right to live in an ethical and healthy society, the right to attribution for intellectual, artistic, and/or creative work, and the right to freedom of action and expression. These rights will frequently conflict with one another; in such instances, the relative value of each right should be considered and the action taken which seems best advised.</p> <p>Wisdom is vital to spiritual growth. It is not effectively gained through the unconditional acceptance of what one is told; rather, it is preferable to assess the information one encounters and the experiences one has, and evaluate them and from the draw one’s individual conclusion of what is true. Conversely, beliefs should not be forced upon others. Wisdom should be respected; for this reason, books should never have writing added to them by those other than the author, should never have adhesives affixed to them, should be handled with proper archival procedure if possible (using only acid-free paper inserts for identification), and should be protected from damage or destruction. All documents, artworks, and other objects of notable historic significance should also be retained as best possible. Immoral knowledge should be kept from those who would be damaged by it, but even that should be archived and retained for the completeness of the historic record.</p> <p>Nature and earth should be protected. Humans have had a significant and widespread effect on the earth, and have damaged it. This carries the risk of adversely affecting its ability to provide those necessities to humans that they rely upon.</p> <p>The Russian composer Igor Stravinsky wrote that music can be created and given form because its boundaries place it within a framework that enables it its existence.</p> <blockquote>“Will I then have to lose myself in this abyss of freedom? To what shall I cling in order to escape the dizziness that seizes me before the virtuality of this infinitude? However, I shall not succumb. I shall overcome my terror and shall be reassured by the thought that I have the seven notes of the scale and its chromatic intervals at my disposal, that strong and weak accents are within my reach, and that in all of these I possess solid and concrete elements which offer me a field of experience just as vast as the upsetting and dizzy infinitude that had just frightened me.”</blockquote> <p>At the same time, the passing outside of boundaries can play a role in forming something’s existence, as well. When the world was created, it was created through conscious intention, by some omnipotent being, and at the same time granted its own intention. It was deliberately given the power for self-direction, the power to create. In giving the world this self-direction, its creator used the creator’s omnipotence to limit its own power. This was accomplished through the creation of a system which is inherently unpredictable. When playing a role in the world, it is impossible to be a fully non-influencing observer, because things will always be affected by the act of observing them, as a consequence of the uncertainty principle. Thus, system state prediction is impossible. That is why one cannot see the future, and can only look at one’s past inasmuch as it is remembered in the present. In ancient Greece, the cognitive metaphor for time was that the future was behind one, and the past in front of one, since one can only see what is in the past. If a person can know the future, or if he is fated to make a decision, he does not have self-direction. If one single person had self-direction, maybe that one person could know the future: but when more than one person has autonomy, none can know the future with absolute certainty. If God knew the future, He would not have given humans self-direction, because for him to know the outcome of the world, the decisions must have already been determined.</p> <p>Technological development holds great value for the continuation and improvement of humanity. Humans have been given technologically inclined minds; it seems that perhaps we are intended by some higher power to use them for our mutual betterment. For example, existing electronic tattoo technology could be used to integrate computing tools into the human body, and artificial insemination and cloning could be used to eliminate the need for sexuality (and its urges’ consequent damaging effects on society). It seems likely that the development of cyberorganisms could substantially reduce the inefficiencies and social challenges of humanity.</p> <p>When beings are aware of God, this awareness is the source of His power within them. When they know the power of God, He is made to exist for them. His power is a divine construct given meaning through conscious awareness, a meta-apotheosis of sorts — a power found consciously through the unconscious divine. He has power within His creations if they are aware of Him, but He nevertheless always exists outside of their awareness. God’s bringing forth of His power can lead to its recognition in the eyes of the living and it is through this recognition that it is made real for them. God is the source and creator of this power, but it must be made real by those within whom it resides. One can believe God exists without having faith that his actions are always just. Someone can believe in God without faith in His justice, or else someone can believe in God and have faith that He is just, and perhaps has compassion and empathy. The conditions of both belief in God and faith in his justice must be satisfied for a morally sovereign being to be able to know and respect His path. God is just, but His independent creations are not forced to conform to His justice. While they do have an ethical obligation to be just, there nevertheless does not exist any true guaranteed way to force them to be. If people believe that God cares about them, God then likely has some power over them through their belief in Him and their faith in His justice. They would then have their morally sovereign choices influenced by God’s will, but those choices would be realized through their own power. The Israelites doubted God, and He showed them His power repeatedly through the soulbinder Moses; in doing this, God eventually validated His strength for them, and they thus acted in accordance with what they perceived as His will. Rather than simply believing God exists, having faith in him is what is needed to be true to His will. God deliberately put restraints on His own omnipotence. If God is omnipotent, that must include the power to take away his own powers. Thus, He must not have absolute power to control every aspect of the world, or injustice would not exist. God has taken away His direct influence over the world and given living things the capacity for moral self-direction. Because of this, He has power over His creations when they are aware of His existence and His care for them. God cares about everything that happens, even if He cannot control it. A God that would sit by and watch the universal tragedies of moral self-direction while having the power to stop them would be an unjust God. The pain of moral sovereignty then invites the question: if God is omniscient, could not He have predicted such pain when he granted all living things this moral sovereignty? He could not. As an omnipotent being He would have the ability to give his creation the power for absolute self-direction, without the fate consequential of predictable physics, and correspondingly he would likewise have the ability to take away His own power to predict the path of His creation’s chaos. We need to understand the true nature of the world as we can perceive it before we can begin to understand the nature of the unknowable divine. The fettered omniscience of God’s knowledge of His creation has been implemented in what has been recognized as the theory of the uncertainty principle in quantum physics, according to which nothing can be predicted with absolute certainty. Traditional thinking would seem to hold that through a comprehensive understanding of all the positions and vectors in a closed system, all of the states of that situation — past, present, and future — can be known simultaneously. Yet the observer effect leads to the situation that the most basic particles of matter are unable to be observed or predicted, because any observation will inevitably change their state, thus contributing to the chaos inherent in the uncertainty principle. Maybe that is the manner in which God has created the world, the manner in which He granted its inhabitants moral sovereignty. Unpredictability can itself be restrained by certain constraints and rules, for example, gravity. If I am holding a ball and open my fingers, I can predict that it will begin falling as soon as my hand has departed from around it. Yet it is impossible to predict with such certainty whether I will choose to release it, or when I would do so. If God has the ability to create this bounded unpredictability, then moral sovereignty can truly exist, without the need for the nihilism of fate or predestination.</p> <p>In Inanna, there is a wide range of personalities and emotions that are symbolic of duality, for example, the contrast and connection between the tragic figure of Ereshkigal and the hopeful figure of Inanna. The presentation of Ereshkigal as a tragic figure in this text is quite striking: rather than the conventional image of the ruler of the underworld as a demon, she is someone who seeks friendship and compassion but is unable to have it. Her response to the kurgarra and galatur shows her desire for connection and understanding. She has become very angry and harsh from the emotional challenges she faced historically, namely the lack of any human emotional connection. She is the dark counterpart to Inanna’s aliveness, and hates Inanna for being able to experience what she desires. When Inanna was killed by Ereshkigal, Enki created the kurgarra and galatur, and instructed them to visit Ereshkigal and sympathize with her, so she would allow them to resurrect Inanna. The kurgarra and galatur did not understand Ereshkigal, though. Ereshkigal had not found the connection she needed in them. When Inanna was resurrected by the kurgarra and galatur, she tried to leave the underworld. The judges of the underworld, the Annuna, refused to let her leave without another taking her place, and sent the galla demons with her to bring a replacement back. The Annuna established a strict setting that seemed to follow more rigid protocols than Ereshkigal demanded. She did not feel one way or another about what people did; she seemed to have sort of a numbness to the world around her, to anything outside of her own mind, not caring particularly about what happened beyond her personal desires. This was balanced by the Annuna, who did not seem to have any human desires, but rather to simply be unbiased judges: the guardians and managers of the underworld. The galla, demons of the underworld, likewise did not have any particularly human traits, not having any concern about human relationships or knowing any human enjoyments. The galla and Annuna are needed to maintain balance in the universe between the living and the dead; without them, Ereshkigal would not have enough investment in what happened to maintain a structured, orderly system, since she would be too swayed by her individual desires. Even though the galla allowed Inanna to play a role in deciding who to send to the underworld in her place, I do not think that necessarily points to an emotional trait on their part; rather it might simply be that it does not matter to them who goes in her place. When Inanna chose to descend into the underworld, Neti, the gatekeeper of the underworld, asked her why she had come. Inanna replied, initially, that she was going for the sake of Ereshkigal, to attend the funeral of her husband, Gugalanna. Since Ereshkigal is Inanna’s counterpart, maybe Inanna knew on some level that Ereshkigal needed company, even though Ereshkigal may not have known that herself, and Inanna, in her compassion, went to be with her. Inanna was an inseparable part of Ereshkigal. The links between Ereshkigal and Inanna are found in the parallels between their relationships, as well. Both are widowed, their husbands, Gugalanna and Dumuzi, having died. Gugalanna was the Bull of Heaven, and Dumuzi was the Wild Bull, Ereshkigal and Gugalanna being Inanna and Dumuzi’s spiritual counterparts. The codependence of Inanna and Ereshkigal was representative of the balance needed in the world. As we discussed in class, this duality is widely evident throughout the symbolism in the stories of Inanna. It is a consequence of the importance of fertility in Sumerian culture, male and female being a metaphor for the agricultural lifestyle at the heart of the Sumerian society. Cultural views of human traits and failings are mirrored in these religious views, with the divine figures echoing human struggles. In Inanna, the emotions of the subjects are a critical element of the stories, giving them depth and the ability to connect to the reader. The symbolic theme of duality is central to the ideas presented in the stories, embodied in two opposite characters, Ereshkigal and Inanna.</p> <p>In Dao De Jing, the attributed author Laozi discusses a wide range of subjects, all through simple, concise aphorisms. The Daoist philosophy constructs a new form of paired duality, in which contrasting philosophical elements of presence and absence are inherently equal. Both the Laozi’s and Hein’s literature imbue their short literary form with many layers of meaning. Much in the manner of the Dutch poet and intellectual Piet Hein, Laozi is able to convey in this work many-layered, richly faceted concepts and meanings using far fewer words than would be ordinarily expected of such complex commentary and meaning, with reflection and analysis allowing the reader to find his own truths within them as well. The deceptively simple words of this poetry lead the mind to initially jump to some “obvious” interpretation, while further reflection and thought yields many more. They can be read repeatedly, a reader still finding new meaning in them upon every contemplation. Where the two diverge is in ambiguity: while they both share initially enigmatic and occasionally satirical stylistic traits, Hein's writing generally has some certain clear, fundamental meaning, less wide open to interpretation than the Dao De Jing. The Dao De Jing uses symbolism extensively. Its symbolic elements contrast and pair together the concepts of presence, yang, and emptiness, yin. This was novel in its time and place, paralleling the duality in Sumerian culture between the equals Inanna and Ereshkigal. The Daoist philosophy of equivalent duality broke apart traditional dualities which viewed the two as mutually incompatible entities: presence immutably good, and emptiness a frightening threat to be subsumed and filled. Clearly indicative of the lacunary traits inherent in this text are the presence of metaphors of the void: concepts of nothingness are used pervasively to define and delineate the way of life, and the progression by and through which things occur. Laozi writes: “Raise up whom you would remove, and provide when you mean to deprive. That is to do the unseen, unseen.” In this, the symbolic strength of the “nothingness” is to be there as a void having a sort of metaphorical pride in its accessible, generous strength. This nothingness is a nothingness which is not null, but rather void; it is not defined as encompassing nothing, but rather simply not defined as encompassing something. Jacques Lusseyran, a writer and World War II underground French resistance leader, recognized this nature of the void, in a sense — yet, as a torment — in his autobiography And There Was Light, writing of “…a void which filled me…” — a void with the capacity to exist as itself, to be a justified, true entity, not a defined null. The Daoist ideals of presence and emptiness form two necessary, fundamentally interdependent sides of the same coin. This contrast mirrors the contrasts between elements of Judaism and Theistic or Gnostic Luciferianism. The two religions have similar moral and ethical ideals and objectives, and are rooted in some of the same philosophical traditions, but use largely inverse imagery of deities. Judaism’s deity imagery is very immaterial: an intangible, unknowable God, yet a God with a direct, omnipotent influence over creation. Luciferianism's inspiration of hope is the Morning Star (Lucifer — the Light Bearer — in the Christian tradition; Inanna (Ištar) (Akkadian 𒀭𒈹 / Sumerian 𒀭𒌋𒁯) in the Sumerian tradition; or some interpretations of Lilith). Although the Morning Star figure has radically different interpretations and significances to different cultures and belief systems (for example, the Sumerian tradition is centered on fertility and food, but the Gnostic tradition is centered on self-denial) the symbolic parallels of the figure within its various cultures have a commonality in its position as a source of hope and inspiration. The Morning Star is often seen as acting through the truth of sophia (wisdom) and the capacity of humans to achieve some spiritual enlightenment through the rejection of the physical world (harkening back, incidentally, to Daoism’s strength of the nothingness). This is a very concrete, physical deity in the Sumerian tradition, reflecting the Sumerian agricultural economy (yet not a deity necessarily given to “micromanaging”, to use a word the author Mary Doria Russell uses to refer to some interpretations of God). This contrast between the two schools of thought echoes the contrast in Daoism found in the presence-absence duality. In the Tangut empire, declared independent in 1038 AD and destroyed by the Mongols in 1227, religion was predominantly Buddhist. The Tangut empire was a socially progressive nation with pioneering civil rights ethics, and since freedom of religious expression was protected, Daoism was a significant secondary religion in the empire. The son of the first emperor Jingzong, Prince Ning Ming, was a Daoist scholar, and noted for his Daoist leadership views and pacifism. “When asked about the ways of state governance, [Prince Ning Ming] said that it was necessary to have few desires and to cleanse the heart.” (Guilin Discovery Network Technology Co., Ltd.: Western Xia Customs — Sequel II) This is advice found throughout the Dao De Jing: In stanza 7, it is written “By disowning what they yield, Heaven can last and earth endure. So, surely, does the world-wise lord, who puts his interest far behind, and ends up in the lead…”. The Tangut empire was one of the first civilizations to have large print runs of books created using movable type, in some cases with single print runs of up to 100,000 copies of books. Through this range of parallels to and examples of Daoism, one can see the breadth of possibilities offered within the deceptively simple text of the Dao De Jing. In this revolutionary book, Laozi has discarded certain assumptions and cognitive metaphors about the nature of reality regarding the value of presence and absence. In doing so, he has created a truly universal text, in which truths can be found to apply to nearly any context.</p> <p>Gnosticism is a group of belief systems sharing certain core tenets, particularly the focuses on the development of sophia (wisdom) to attain gnosis (knowledge) and on the rejection of the physical world in the endeavor to attain ascendance into the spiritual. It shares common themes and elements with many Christian and other belief systems. Syncretism is the sharing of discrete elements between belief systems. The texts we have studied in this unit are a perfect example of such a fusing of religious elements, sharing many commonalities both between the Gnostic and non-Gnostic gospels, and with the texts we have studied over this past semester and a half. While Gnosticism is a term applied to a range of diverse, in some ways incompatible belief systems (such as Sethianism, Gnostic Luciferianism, and Mandaeism), Gnostic belief systems retain the shared basis of Gnostic thinking, presenting one excellent example of the presence of distinct common elements shared between a variety of belief systems. A wide range of shared themes and symbolism are also visible in other religious contexts, such as mainstream modern Christian faiths, Daoism, Buddhism, and the Sumerian religion seen in Inanna. In the non-canonical gospels, there were many shared themes with Gnostic writings; thus these gospels have become known as the Gnostic gospels. That does not necessarily indicate a shared Gnostic origin for them, but rather indicates that they share elements of the diverse Gnostic tradition. For example, the gospel of Judas is strongly Sethian (“The first is [S]eth, who is called Christ”, p. 6), while the gospel of Thomas is a more general Christian text with some common themes of Gnosticism (it may have played a role in the development of the general themes of the Gnostic tradition). In the Gospel of Mary, it is written “There is no sin, but it is you who make sin when you do the things that are like the nature of adultery, which is called sin.” This sentence emphasizes the Gnostic nature of the text, in its equating of sin with adultery providing a connection to the traditional Gnostic focus on the rejection of the physical in the interest of the finding of knowledge through wisdom. The parallels in name symbolism in religious traditions are very interesting. In the And the parallels between spiritual figures that cross over between various religious traditions. That is very noticeable in the Roman and Greek traditions, which have very significant parallel between them, with many individual gods corresponding between one and the other. But also between other religions such as Christianity and Sumerian tradition, the most obvious example being the parallel between Jesus and Inanna, both known as the Morning Star to their respective cultures. For example, in the Exsultet, the line “Flammas ejus lúcifer matutínus invéniat: Ille, inquam, lúcifer, qui nescit occásum: Christus Fílius tuus, qui, regréssus ab ínferis, humáno géneri serénus illúxit”… refers to Jesus as the Morning Star: “May this flame be found still burning by the Morning Star: the one Morning Star who never sets, Christ your Son, who coming back from death’s domain has shed his peaceful light on humanity”. (http://www.ccwatershed.org/exsultet/) These are a few examples of the many interesting facets of the sharing of ideas within a diverse array of religions, as well as of the role name symbolism can play in the context of religious thought. In religion, there is frequent overlap and sharing of common elements between various faiths, creating a diverse religious culture that is nevertheless interconnected. For example, Gnosticism is a group of belief systems sharing certain core tenets, particularly the focuses on the development of sophia (wisdom) to attain gnosis (knowledge) and on the rejection of the physical world in the endeavor to attain ascendance into the spiritual.

The Daoist philosophy of equivalent duality broke apart traditional dualities which viewed the two as mutually incompatible entities: presence immutably good, and emptiness a frightening threat to be subsumed and filled.

(http://www.ccwatershed.org/exsultet/ ) Another example of name symbolism is found in the Jewish tradition's naming of the first humans: Cain's name symbolizes worldly things, material goods, and possessions; Abel's name symbolizes the immaterial, the ethereal, and the intangible, and Seth's name refers to the “appointed”, a concept later reflected in the Sethian equating of Christ to Seth. These symbolic meanings of these names have held a long-lasting and pervasive influence on the understanding and portrayal of these figures in religion and popular culture, even as far afield as in their characterizations in the anime Trinity Blood. These are a few examples of the many interesting facets of the sharing of ideas within a diverse array of religions, as well as of the role name symbolism can play in the context of religious thought.</p> <p>An important salient point that Francis Bacon makes in his Great Instauration is that “man is but the servant and interpreter of nature": In this, Bacon makes the point that humans are, in scientific observance, simply looking at the nature of which they are a part, and placing an interpretation as best they can reconcile from their observations upon it. Perhaps, even, it could be said that this is much as the analogy of the observation of water by a fish: Humans are one part of nature, swimming within it as their lifelong context of existence, and in science we try to assess and come to terms with the water of the nature around us.</p> </main> </body> </html>
